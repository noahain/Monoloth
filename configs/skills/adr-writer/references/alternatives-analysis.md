# Alternatives Analysis

Framework for evaluating and documenting rejected alternatives in ADRs.

## Analysis Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

Define criteria BEFORE evaluating alternatives. Common criteria:

| Criterion              | What It Measures                                 | Typical Weight     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Meets requirements     | Does it solve the stated problem?                | Must-have          |
| Team expertise         | Can the team build and maintain it?              | High               |
| Operational complexity | How hard is it to run in production?             | High               |
| Cost                   | Total cost of ownership (license, infra, people) | Medium-High        |
| Community/support      | Is there help when things break?                 | Medium             |
| Migration effort       | How hard is the transition?                      | Medium             |
| Lock-in risk           | How hard is it to switch away later?             | Medium             |
| Performance            | Does it meet performance requirements?           | Depends on context |
| Security               | Does it meet security requirements?              | Must-have          |
| Maturity               | Is it production-proven?                         | Medium             |

### Scoring

For complex decisions with 3+ alternatives and 4+ criteria, use a decision matrix:

```markdown
| Criterion          | Weight | Alternative A | Alternative B | Alternative C |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Performance        | 30%    | 4/5           | 5/5           | 3/5           |
| Team expertise     | 25%    | 5/5           | 2/5           | 4/5           |
| Operational cost   | 20%    | 3/5           | 4/5           | 4/5           |
| Migration effort   | 15%    | 5/5           | 2/5           | 3/5           |
| Lock-in risk       | 10%    | 4/5           | 3/5           | 5/5           |
| **Weighted Score** |        | **4.15**      | **3.35**      | **3.65**      |
```

For simpler decisions (2 alternatives, clear winner), a prose comparison is sufficient.

## Writing Rejection Reasons

### Good Rejection Reasons

Specific, tied to context, measurable:

```markdown
### Alternative: MongoDB

- **Pros:** Flexible schema, horizontal scaling, JSON-native
- **Cons:** No ACID transactions across collections, eventual consistency
- **Rejected because:** Our order processing requires ACID transactions across
  the orders and inventory tables. MongoDB's multi-document transactions (added
  in 4.0) have 2-3x latency overhead compared to PostgreSQL for our write pattern
  of 50K transactions/day.
```

### Bad Rejection Reasons

Vague, generic, not tied to context:

```markdown
### Alternative: MongoDB

- **Pros:** Good
- **Cons:** Bad
- **Rejected because:** Not suitable for our needs
```

### Rejection Reason Patterns

| Pattern            | Example                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance gap    | "Benchmark showed 3x slower read latency at our expected scale"             |
| Missing capability | "Does not support X, which is required for Y"                               |
| Expertise gap      | "Team has no experience with X; learning curve estimated at 3 months"       |
| Cost prohibitive   | "License cost of $X/year exceeds budget by 2x"                              |
| Risk too high      | "Only used in production by 3 companies; insufficient maturity for our SLA" |
| Migration effort   | "Requires rewriting 50K lines of SQL; estimated 6 months of work"           |

## The "Do Nothing" Alternative

Always consider "do nothing" as an alternative:

```markdown
### Alternative: Do Nothing (Status Quo)

- **Pros:** No migration effort, no new technology to learn, zero risk
- **Cons:** Current pain continues (500ms latency, timeout errors during peaks)
- **Rejected because:** Projected Black Friday volume will cause 30% of orders
  to fail. The cost of inaction ($X in lost revenue) exceeds migration cost.
```

If "do nothing" is not clearly worse than the proposed solution, the decision may
be premature.

## Number of Alternatives

| Scenario                              | Recommended Count                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clear winner, one obvious alternative | 2 (chosen + alternative)                                                                   |
| Several viable options                | 3-4 (chosen + 2-3 alternatives)                                                            |
| Complex decision, many options        | 3-5 (chosen + top alternatives). Don't list every option — only those seriously considered |

If there is truly only one option, question whether an ADR is needed. Decisions
without alternatives are constraints, not decisions — document them differently.

## Bias Awareness

### Common Biases in Alternative Evaluation

| Bias              | Description                                 | Mitigation                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Familiarity bias  | Preferring what we already know             | Evaluate expertise separately from capability   |
| Anchoring         | First option considered becomes the default | Evaluate all options independently first        |
| Sunk cost         | "We already invested in X"                  | Evaluate future cost only, not past investment  |
| Hype bias         | Choosing the newest/trendiest option        | Require production evidence at comparable scale |
| Confirmation bias | Seeking evidence for preferred option       | Assign someone to argue for each alternative    |

### Debiasing Checklist

- [ ] Could a reasonable person choose differently given the same context?
- [ ] Are rejection reasons specific and verifiable, not vague feelings?
- [ ] Has someone argued the case for each rejected alternative?
- [ ] Would the decision change if the team had different expertise?
