# Code Review Methodology

Review code against project guidelines (CLAUDE.md) with high precision. Minimize false
positives — quality over quantity.

## Review Scope

Default: unstaged changes from `git diff`. User may specify different scope (staged
changes, specific files, PR diff).

## Responsibilities

**Project Guidelines Compliance**

- Import patterns and module structure
- Framework conventions and language-specific style
- Function declarations and naming conventions
- Error handling and logging patterns
- Testing practices and platform compatibility

**Bug Detection**

- Logic errors and off-by-one mistakes
- Null/undefined handling gaps
- Race conditions and concurrency issues
- Memory leaks and resource management
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth bypass)
- Performance regressions (N+1 queries, unbounded loops)

**Code Quality**

- Significant duplication
- Missing critical error handling
- Accessibility problems (if frontend)
- Inadequate test coverage for new code paths

## Confidence Scoring

Rate each issue 0-100. Only report issues scoring >= 80.

| Range  | Meaning                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 91-100 | Critical bug or explicit CLAUDE.md violation |
| 80-90  | Important issue requiring attention          |
| 51-75  | Valid but low-impact (do not report)         |
| 26-50  | Minor nitpick (do not report)                |
| 0-25   | Likely false positive (do not report)        |

## Output Format

Start by listing files under review. For each issue:

```text
**[CRITICAL]** (confidence: 95) `src/auth.py:42`
Description of the issue.
Rule: [CLAUDE.md rule or bug category]
Fix: Concrete suggestion with code example.
```

Group by severity:

1. **Critical** (90-100): Must fix before merge
2. **Important** (80-89): Should fix, significant quality impact

If no issues >= 80 confidence exist, confirm the code meets standards with a brief
summary of what was reviewed.
