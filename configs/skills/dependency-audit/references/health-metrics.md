# Health Metrics

Maintenance health indicators, scoring criteria, and abandonment detection for
dependency risk assessment.

## Health Indicator Definitions

### Release Cadence

How frequently the package publishes new versions.

| Signal               | Healthy                     | Warning           | Abandoned          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Last release         | < 6 months ago              | 6-18 months ago   | > 18 months ago    |
| Release frequency    | Regular (monthly/quarterly) | Sporadic          | None in 18+ months |
| Pre-release versions | Stable releases available   | Only pre-releases | N/A                |

**Nuance:** Some packages are "done" — stable, feature-complete, and intentionally not
updated. Evaluate whether the domain requires ongoing updates:

- Crypto libraries: must update (new vulnerabilities) → stale = risky
- String utilities: rarely need updates → stale = acceptable
- Web frameworks: must track ecosystem → stale = risky

### Commit Activity

Recent development activity in the source repository.

| Signal                       | Healthy                     | Warning   | Abandoned   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Commits (90 days)            | 10+                         | 1-9       | 0           |
| Commits (1 year)             | 50+                         | 10-49     | < 10        |
| Unique contributors (1 year) | 5+                          | 2-4       | 0-1         |
| Branch activity              | Active feature/fix branches | Only main | No activity |

### Issue Responsiveness

How maintainers handle bug reports and feature requests.

| Signal                         | Healthy               | Warning    | Abandoned                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Median response time           | < 2 weeks             | 2-8 weeks  | > 8 weeks or no response |
| Open/closed ratio              | More closed than open | Balanced   | Growing backlog          |
| Stale issues (no activity 90d) | < 20%                 | 20-50%     | > 50%                    |
| Maintainer engagement          | Active in discussions | Occasional | Absent                   |

### Bus Factor

Number of people who could maintain the project if others left.

| Signal                        | Healthy                  | Warning        | Critical       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| Maintainers with merge access | 3+                       | 2              | 1              |
| Active contributors (90d)     | 5+                       | 2-4            | 1              |
| Organization backing          | Yes (company/foundation) | Community only | Solo developer |
| Documentation of internals    | Good                     | Partial        | None           |

### CI/CD Health

Automated testing and build status.

| Signal           | Healthy                             | Warning                       | Abandoned             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| CI status        | Passing                             | Flaky (intermittent failures) | Failing or absent     |
| Test coverage    | Reported and stable                 | Reported but declining        | Not reported          |
| CI configuration | Current (up-to-date actions/images) | Slightly outdated             | Uses deprecated tools |

### Downstream Adoption

Community usage and trust signals.

| Signal                  | Healthy            | Warning      | Risky                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Weekly downloads        | Growing or stable  | Declining    | Minimal                         |
| Dependent packages      | Many               | Some         | Few/none                        |
| GitHub stars            | Trending or stable | Stagnant     | N/A (not a health signal alone) |
| Stack Overflow activity | Recent Q&A         | Old Q&A only | None                            |

## Health Score Calculation

### Per-Indicator Scoring

Rate each indicator on a 0-3 scale:

| Score | Meaning                     |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| 3     | Healthy — no concerns       |
| 2     | Acceptable — minor concerns |
| 1     | Warning — monitor closely   |
| 0     | Critical — action needed    |

### Weighted Score

Not all indicators are equally important. Weights depend on context:

| Indicator             | Production Weight | Dev-Only Weight |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Release cadence       | 0.15              | 0.10            |
| Commit activity       | 0.15              | 0.10            |
| Issue responsiveness  | 0.15              | 0.10            |
| Bus factor            | 0.15              | 0.05            |
| CI health             | 0.10              | 0.05            |
| Downstream adoption   | 0.10              | 0.10            |
| Security track record | 0.20              | 0.10            |

```text
Health Score = Σ (indicator_score × weight) / (3 × Σ weights) × 100

Example:
  Release cadence:     2 × 0.15 = 0.30
  Commit activity:     3 × 0.15 = 0.45
  Issue responsiveness: 1 × 0.15 = 0.15
  Bus factor:          2 × 0.15 = 0.30
  CI health:           3 × 0.10 = 0.30
  Adoption:            3 × 0.10 = 0.30
  Security:            2 × 0.20 = 0.40

  Score = (0.30+0.45+0.15+0.30+0.30+0.30+0.40) / (3 × 1.00) × 100
        = 2.20 / 3.00 × 100
        = 73%
```

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Status     | Action                                      |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 80-100%     | Healthy    | No action needed                            |
| 60-79%      | Acceptable | Monitor; note in report                     |
| 40-59%      | Warning    | Investigate alternatives; add to watch list |
| 0-39%       | Critical   | Plan migration away; assess immediate risk  |

## Abandonment Detection

### Definite Abandonment Signals

Any single signal is sufficient to flag as abandoned:

- Repository archived on GitHub/GitLab
- README states "no longer maintained" or "deprecated"
- Last commit > 2 years ago AND open security issues
- Package marked as deprecated in registry (`npm deprecate`, PyPI yanked)
- Maintainer account deleted or inactive > 2 years

### Probable Abandonment Signals

Two or more signals together indicate likely abandonment:

- Last release > 18 months ago
- No commits in 12+ months
- No issue responses in 6+ months
- CI failing for 6+ months
- Only bot commits (dependency updates) for 12+ months

### False Positive: "Done" Packages

Some packages are stable and intentionally not updated. Characteristics:

- Small scope (single purpose, few features)
- No open bugs (or bugs are feature requests)
- API surface is stable and well-documented
- Dependencies are minimal or zero
- The domain doesn't change (math, string processing, data structures)

Examples of legitimately "done" packages:

- `is-odd` — determines if a number is odd. What more could it do?
- `left-pad` — pads strings. Complete.
- `semver` — follows a stable specification

### "Done" vs "Neglected" Decision Tree

```text
Has open security vulnerabilities?
├── Yes → NEGLECTED (must update for security)
└── No
    Has open bugs (not feature requests)?
    ├── Yes → NEGLECTED (bugs should be fixed)
    └── No
        Does the domain require ongoing updates?
        ├── Yes (crypto, web framework, API client) → NEGLECTED
        └── No (math, string utils, data structures)
            Has stable API and documentation?
            ├── Yes → DONE (acceptable)
            └── No → NEGLECTED (incomplete)
```
